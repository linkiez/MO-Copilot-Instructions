## üåü Why This Repository Exists

Modern development involves collaborating not only with people, but also with AI tools. This repository aims to:

- Document repeatable prompting patterns and interaction styles.
- Encourage responsible and ethical AI-assisted development.
- Provide reusable snippets, templates, and workflows.
- Evolve through community input and real-world usage.

If you‚Äôve ever thought ‚ÄúI figured out a great way to ask Copilot for X ‚Äî others should know this,‚Äù this is the place to share it.

## üóÇ Repository Structure

Below is a suggested structure (update this section to reflect the actual layout as the repo evolves):

```
/prompts/              -> Curated prompt patterns
/patterns/             -> Pattern explanations (e.g. "Refactor Loop", "Explain Commit")
/workflows/            -> Multi-step AI-assisted workflows
/examples/             -> Before/after transformations or generated outputs
/guides/               -> Narrative documents (ethics, best practices, limits)
/meta/                 -> Governance, templates, style decisions
README.md
CONTRIBUTING.md        -> (Optional: can be extracted from this README)
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md     -> (Recommended)
LICENSE
```

If a directory doesn‚Äôt exist yet, feel free to propose and create it in a PR along with rationale.

## üí° Usage Ideas

You can use this repository to:

- Copy/paste refined prompts for repeatable tasks.
- Learn phrasing strategies for better AI responses.
- Build internal team guidelines by forking.
- Track evolution of prompt engineering approaches.
- Compare output quality from different prompting styles.

---

## ü§ù Contributing

All contributions are welcome ‚Äî including very small ones. Examples:

- Fixing typos or formatting
- Adding a new prompt pattern
- Documenting an edge case or failure mode
- Improving clarity or structure
- Adding a comparison example (bad prompt vs improved prompt)
- Translating content (open an issue first to coordinate)

If unsure whether something belongs: open a draft PR or issue to discuss.

---

## üîÅ Pull Request Workflow

1. Fork or create a branch (e.g., `feat/<short-description>`).
2. Make focused changes (small PRs merge faster).
3. Ensure:
   - Files use consistent tone (see Style section).
   - New patterns include: intent, structure, example, limitations.
4. Reference related issues if applicable (e.g., `Closes #12`).
5. Mark as Draft if still experimenting.
6. Await feedback ‚Äî maintainers will:
   - Suggest edits
   - Merge
   - Or request clarification

## üß™ Prompt Crafting Guide

When adding a prompt pattern, try to include:

| Section        | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Name           | Short, descriptive (e.g., "Iterative Refactor Loop") |
| Use Case       | When to use it |
| Template       | A reusable scaffold |
| Example        | Concrete input + output |
| Variations     | Optional tweaks |
| Failure Modes  | How it may go wrong |
| Mitigations    | How to recover |

Sample Format:

```
# Pattern: Iterative Refactor Loop

Use Case:
Improve legacy function clarity without changing behavior.

Template:
"Refactor the following code for readability, keeping logic identical. 
Return: 1) Improved code 2) Explanation of changes 3) Potential edge cases not handled."

Example Input:
<code>

Example Output:
<code>

Failure Modes:
- Drops edge-case checks
- Renames externally used symbols

Mitigations:
- Add explicit 'Do not rename public API symbols'
```

## üßæ AI Usage & Attribution

To promote transparency:
- If significant content was AI-generated, note it (e.g., footer: ‚ÄúPortions generated with AI and reviewed by humans.‚Äù).
- Avoid copy/pasting raw AI output without review.
- Do not include proprietary or sensitive data in prompts.
- Report hallucinated facts so we can annotate them.

---

## üß∑ Quality & Style Guidelines

- Tone: clear, neutral, instructive.
- Avoid hype terms unless contextually relevant.
- Prefer examples over abstract description.
- Use American English (or note variation).
- Wrap lines at ~100‚Äì120 chars where practical for diff readability.
- Use Markdown headings semantically (do not skip levels).
- Use fenced code blocks with proper language tags.

| 2     | Add failure case catalog        | Planned |
| 3     | Introduce multilingual prompts  | Planned |
| 4     | Tool-specific sub-guides        | Planned |
